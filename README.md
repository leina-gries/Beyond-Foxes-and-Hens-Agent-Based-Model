# OO-Ecosystem-Model
Using object oriented coding to design a very detailed model of an ecosystem. 
Currently models the interactions between a plant species, an environment, weather, and an herbivore. Working through the efficiency of this before moving on to the predator-prey interactions, which should be simple if done using the architecture designed for breeding. 
Living, developing code. Will continue to grow and develop as my knowledge and understanding does.
